# Victory Native

This package imports components from `victory-core-native`, `victory-pie-native`, and `victory-chart-native`

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then open `demo/ios/Demo.xcodeproj` and run the app. (Note: `npm start` must run _before_ you run the app).

## _IMPORTANT_

This project is in a pre-release state. We're hard at work fixing bugs and improving the API. Be prepared for breaking changes!
